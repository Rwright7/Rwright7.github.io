## Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting world of programming! Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your skills, this guide will help you get started on your programming journey.

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start writing code, it's essential to set up your programming environment. Depending on the programming language you want to learn, you may need to install specific tools and compilers.

### Choosing a Programming Language

There are numerous programming languages to choose from, each with its strengths and use cases. Some popular languages include:

- Front-end web development (user interface and interaction): Javascript, HTML & CSS
- Back-end web development (services that front-end web apps and mobile apps call out to): Ruby, Python, Javascript, or PHP
- Mobile development: Swift (iOS) or Java (Android)
- Windows development: C#
- MacOS development: Swift or Objective-C
- Operating systems, file systems, embedded systems, etc.: C/C++
- Game development: (C++, Unity, and C#)
- Data Science: R

Select a language based on your goals and the type of applications you want to build.

## Writing Your First Code

Let's dive right in and write a simple "Hello, World!" program. Open your preferred code editor, create a new file, and type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
