# Materials
- Book - Principles of Physics: A Calculus-Based Text, 5th Edition

# Objective
- Summarize 19.1 - 19.12 with emphasis on "19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6, 19.8, 19.9"

# 19.2
 The focus of this section is on "Properties of Electric Charges" it was a brief section for the simple fact they wanted us to understand 2 princples. 

 1) A negatively charged rubber rod suspended by a string is attracted to a positively charged glass rod.

* Why ? because of Coulomb’s Law which is 19.4. Coulomb’s Law simply states the electric force between two charges is attractive if the charges are opposite in sign and repulsive if they are the same sign.

2) A negatively charged rubber rod is repelled by another negatively charged rubber rod.

* Why ? Again because of Coulomb’s Law which is 19.4. Coulomb’s Law simply states the electric force between two charges is attractive if the charges are opposite in sign and repulsive if they are the same sign.

Things to note
* The net charge in an isolated system is always conserved. Why ? Because a charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between objects. And that is the law of conservation of electric charge.

* Charge is not created in the process. Therefore objects become chargged because eletrons are transferred from one object to the other. One object gains some amount of negative charge from the electrons transferred to it while the other loses an equal amount of negative charge and therefore is left with a positive charge. why?

Because electrons are mobile and can move between materials, while protons are fixed in the nucleus. When rubbing or contact occurs, electrons transfer from the material that holds them loosely to the one that attracts them more strongly. 

We call that *electron affinity of materials* which is a fancy way of saying *“how much a material likes to take electrons.”*

for example: Rubber has higher electron affinity than glass, so when rubbed together, rubber gains electrons (negative), and glass loses electrons (positive).


# 19.3
The focus of this section is on "Insulators and Conductors" this section was also brief, we touched on electric charges moving from one location to another within an object which is called "electrical conduction" and what are electrical conductors and electrical insulators and "charging by induction".

1) What are electrical conductors? They are materials that allow electric charges (usually electrons) to move freely through them. 

Examples: metals like copper, aluminum, and silver.

2) What are electrical insulators? They are materials that do not allow electric charges to move freely. They insulate because their electrons are tightly bound to atoms and cannot move easily.

Examples: rubber, glass, plastic.

3) What are Semiconductors? Well semiconductors are materials whose ability to conduct electricity is between that of a conductor and an insulator. They are used in electronics transistors, and chips because their conductivity can be controlled.

* At low temperature, they act more like insulators.
* When heated or adding impurities, they conduct better.

Examples: silicon (Si), germanium (Ge).


4) What is charging by induction?
	Charging by induction is charging an object without touching it, using the electric field of a charged object.

A simple way to charge something by induction 
* Bring a charged object near a neutral object (no contact).
* The charges in the neutral object rearrange (electrons move).
* Ground the neutral object to let some charges leave or enter.
* Remove the ground, then remove the charged object.

Result - The neutral object becomes charged opposite to the inducing object.

If we should focus on my wording of saying "Ground the neutral object" we would make the connection mentally that one could say that's where the term grounding comes from in a sense. 

What does grounding means? Grounding means providing a path for charges to move between an object and the Earth, which can supply or absorb electrons because the Earth is so large it can take or give virtually unlimited charge.

In charging by induction, grounding lets some charges leave or enter the object, leaving it permanently charged once the ground is removed.

**_Fun fact - If someone house is not properly grounded, the electric charge from lightning has no safe path to the earth. So what happens, well the huge voltage tries to find a path anyway. It then travels through anything connected to the electrical system, like the TV, appliances, or wiring. Which then overloads and damages them, which is why the TV gets fried. But with grounding it gives lightning a direct, low-resistance path to the Earth, protecting appliances and people._**

# 19.4
The focus of this section is on Coulomb's law where they expound on what it is and the formula for it. I'll touch briefly on its purpose and breakdown the formula succiently. 

Coulomb’s law says the electric force between two charges depends on **how big the charges are** and **how far apart they are**. The force is **stronger when charges are larger and closer, and weaker when they are smaller or farther apart**.

$$
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
$$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
