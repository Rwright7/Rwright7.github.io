# Materials
- Book - Principles of Physics: A Calculus-Based Text, 5th Edition

# Objective
- Summarize 19.1 - 19.12 with emphasis on "19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6, 19.8, 19.9"

# 19.2
 The focus of this section is on "Properties of Electric Charges" it was a brief section for the simple fact they wanted us to understand 2 princples. 

 1) A negatively charged rubber rod suspended by a string is attracted to a positively charged glass rod.

* Why ? because of Coulomb’s Law which is 19.4. Coulomb’s Law simply states the electric force between two charges is attractive if the charges are opposite in sign and repulsive if they are the same sign.

2) A negatively charged rubber rod is repelled by another negatively charged rubber rod.

* Why ? Again because of Coulomb’s Law which is 19.4. Coulomb’s Law simply states the electric force between two charges is attractive if the charges are opposite in sign and repulsive if they are the same sign.

Things to note
* The net charge in an isolated system is always conserved. Why ? Because a charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between objects. And that is the law of conservation of electric charge.

* Charge is not created in the process. Therefore objects become chargged because eletrons are transferred from one object to the other. One object gains some amount of negative charge from the electrons transferred to it while the other loses an equal amount of negative charge and therefore is left with a positive charge. why?

Because electrons are mobile and can move between materials, while protons are fixed in the nucleus. When rubbing or contact occurs, electrons transfer from the material that holds them loosely to the one that attracts them more strongly. 

We call that *electron affinity of materials* which is a fancy way of saying *“how much a material likes to take electrons.”*

for example: Rubber has higher electron affinity than glass, so when rubbed together, rubber gains electrons (negative), and glass loses electrons (positive).


# 19.3
The focus of this section is on "Insulators and Conductors" this section was also brief, we touched on electric charges moving from one location to another within an object which is called "electrical conduction" and what are electrical conductors and electrical insulators and "charging by induction".

1) What are electrical conductors? They are materials that allow electric charges (usually electrons) to move freely through them. 

Examples: metals like copper, aluminum, and silver.

2) What are electrical insulators? They are materials that do not allow electric charges to move freely. They insulate because their electrons are tightly bound to atoms and cannot move easily.

Examples: rubber, glass, plastic.

3) What are Semiconductors? Well semiconductors are materials whose ability to conduct electricity is between that of a conductor and an insulator. They are used in electronics transistors, and chips because their conductivity can be controlled.

* At low temperature, they act more like insulators.
* When heated or adding impurities, they conduct better.

Examples: silicon (Si), germanium (Ge).


4) What is charging by induction?
	Charging by induction is charging an object without touching it, using the electric field of a charged object.

A simple way to charge something by induction 
* Bring a charged object near a neutral object (no contact).
* The charges in the neutral object rearrange (electrons move).
* Ground the neutral object to let some charges leave or enter.
* Remove the ground, then remove the charged object.

Result - The neutral object becomes charged opposite to the inducing object.

If we should focus on my wording of saying "Ground the neutral object" we would make the connection mentally that one could say that's where the term grounding comes from in a sense. 

What does grounding means? Grounding means providing a path for charges to move between an object and the Earth, which can supply or absorb electrons because the Earth is so large it can take or give virtually unlimited charge.

In charging by induction, grounding lets some charges leave or enter the object, leaving it permanently charged once the ground is removed.

**_Fun fact - If someone house is not properly grounded, the electric charge from lightning has no safe path to the earth. So what happens, well the huge voltage tries to find a path anyway. It then travels through anything connected to the electrical system, like the TV, appliances, or wiring. Which then overloads and damages them, which is why the TV gets fried. But with grounding it gives lightning a direct, low-resistance path to the Earth, protecting appliances and people._**

# 19.4
The focus of this section is on Coulomb's law where they expound on what it is and the formula for it. I'll touch briefly on its purpose and breakdown the formula succiently. 

Coulomb’s law says the electric force between two charges depends on **how big the charges are** and **how far apart they are**. The force is **stronger when charges are larger and closer, and weaker when they are smaller or farther apart**.

$$
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$$


In looking at the formula, one must identify the charges, which is $$ q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ they are the magnitudes of the two point charges. So the bigger the charges, the bigger the force. Now we look at the the denominator which is "r". "r" is the distance between the centers of the charges. The force decreases with the square of the distance, so if the distance doubles, the force becomes $$\frac{1}{2^2}$$ = $$\frac{1}{4}$$ as strong. "k"is Coulomb’s constant which is $$8.99 * 10^9 N \cdot m^2/c^2$$. its purpose is to set the scale so the units work in newtons(N). The absolute value bars are used to ensure we use the magnitude to calculate the strength of the force. The direction which is whether it attracts or repel depends on the sign of the charges and not the formula itself. Finally we multiply k the constant by the product of $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ to see how strong the interaction is and divide by $$r^2$$ to account for distance weakening the force. 

To tell if "Coulombs law applies" we simple understand that **_it works for point charges or situations where the objects are far enough apart that their size doesn’t matter._**


 **Limitations**
 * It does not work well for extended objects, unless you decide to treat them as a sum of point charges. 
 * The law ignores relativity and motion effects, it accuracy lies where charges are stationary or moving slowly.
 * The formula gives us the magnitude, if we want to know the direction, we must check the signs of the charges separately!!

# 19.5
The focus of this section is one "Electric Fields" and i must admit, it wasn't clear on the first 3 reads. but if i was asked to speak about the three main ideas, section 19.5 was trying to convey, it would be this 
 * What an electric field is?
 * How we measure it?
 * Why it matters? 

I'll try my best to answer, all three main ideas, as clear as possible.

### What an electric field is ?
An electric field is a region around a charged object where other charges feel a force.
Personally I find it comforting to think of an electric field like invisible force zone around a charge. If you put another charge inside that zone, it will feel a push or a pull no touching needed. The closer you are to the charge, the stronger the push or pull, and the direction depends on whether the charges are the same or opposite. if one watches JJK it would be like gojo use of infinity. Gojo’s Infinity creates a zone around him that affects everything approaching, a charge sets up an electric field around itself. 

### How do we measure it ?
Now we measure an electric field by seeing how much force a small test charge would feel in that spot. Formula for that is $$E = \frac{F}{q}$$ the reasoning behind the formula is this we divide by the test charge "q" because a bigger test charge naturally feels a bigger force, even if the field is the same. If we didn’t divide, the number would mix the strength of the field with the size of the test charge, which would be misleading. 

In other words imagine the electric field like a wind blowing through a park. The wind has a certain strength no matter whether you hold a small leaf or a big kite. A big kite feels a stronger push, a tiny leaf feels less. But if you want to describe the wind itself, you can’t just say “the leaf was pushed 2 meters,” because that depends on the **object**. Instead, what you would do is divide the push by the “size” of the object (like the kite’s area, or in electricity, the charge) to get the strength of the wind alone. Therefore by dividing "F" by he test charge "q" tells us the strength of the electric field itself, independent of the size of the test charge.

### Why it matters? 
Theoretically, it matters because the electric field **explains how charges exert forces at a distance**, letting us understand and calculate interactions without requiring direct contact between the charges.

Practically it matters because knowing the electric field lets engineers design circuits, insulators, and lightning protection systems, predicting where and how charges will move so devices and people stay safe.


### Electric Field Due to Continuous Charge Distributions
Simply put is when charges aren’t just single points but spread out over a line, surface, or volume, we use continuous charge distributions to calculate the electric field. So instead of summing a few point charges, we break the distribution into tiny pieces, each with a small charge "dq". Each tiny piece produces a small electric field "dE" at the point we’re interested in. Then we open our calculus toolkit and look for Mr integration. We add up all these tiny fields using integration.

$$ E = \int \frac{k\;dq}{r^2}$$

**However we should note that the exact form depends on whether the charge is along a line (linear), a surface (surface), or a volume (volume charge density).** So yeah this methods allows us to calculate the electric field for rods, plates, spheres, and other shapes, and not just isolated point charges!!


# 19.9
The goal of 19.9 was to describe the general relation between the net electric flux through a closed surface and the charge enclosed by the surface. 

### What is an electric flux?

An electric flux is basically a measure of how much electric field passes through a closed surface overall. If more electric field lines leave the bubble than enter, the net flux is positive; if more enter than leave, it’s negative. If the same number enter and leave, the net flux is zero. It does not matter what shape the surface is. but it depends on whether there’s charge inside it creating those field lines.

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{inside}}{\mathcal E_0}$$

* The numerator is the total charge enclosed by that surface 
* The denominator is permittivity of free space, which sets the scale. In other words is a constant that tells us how easily electric field lines can spread through empty space.

### Usefulness of Gauss's Law

* Well simply put it lets us calculate electric fields easily for symmetric charge distributions (like spheres, cylinders, and planes). And instead of adding up every little charge, we just consider the total charge inside the surface.


# Problem Set Time!

**#5 The magnitude of the electric force between two protons is $$2.30 * 10^{-26}$$\;N. How far apart are they? (a) 0.100 m (b) 0.022 0 m (c) 3.10 m (d) 0.005 70 m (e) 0.480 m**

Answer $$\Rightarrow$$ use coulombs law 

$$F = 2.30 * 10^{-26}\;N,\;\;\;$$
$$q_1 = q_2 = 1.60 * 10^{-19}\; C,\;\;\;$$
$$k = 8.99 * 10^9\;N \cdot m^2/C^2,\;\;\;$$

1) To solve this, you first need to understand what’s given and what’s being asked. Coulomb’s law is usually written to find the force when the distance is known

2) In this problem, we already know the force and the charges—the unknown is the distance. With some basic algebra, we can rearrange the formula to solve for "r".

3) The key is recognizing what’s given, what’s missing, and then adapting the equation to isolate the unknown.

$$r = \sqrt{\frac{k\;q_1\;q_2}{F}}$$

Steps to find the answer on your own

1) Multiply $$k*q_1*q_2$$ 

2) Divide by F 

3) Take the square root

Answer is (a) 0.1 m
