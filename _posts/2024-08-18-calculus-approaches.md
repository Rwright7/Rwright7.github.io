# My Two Cents

- When you open a calculus textbook, many will first test your algebra skills or make comments about your algebra level. Algebra is crucial; if you're not comfortable with it, certain aspects of calculus will be challenging and might stump you.

- I firmly believe that if you put in the effort and gradually build trust in yourself, both in algebra and calculus, you'll succeed.


# Resources

- [Calculus Basics PDF](/assets/Calculus_Basics.pdf)
- [Clep Questions PDF](/assets/Clep_questions-2.pdf)
- [Common Derivatives PDF](/assets/Common_derivatives-2.pdf)
- [Instagram Questions PDF](/assets/Instagram_Questions.pdf)
- [Physics Questions Calc PDF](/assets/Physics_Ques.pdf)
- [Worded Questions Calc PDF](/assets/Worded_Questions_Calc.pdf)
- [CalcDocEasy PDF](/assets/CalcDocEasy.pdf)

- For many reasons, I believe the CalcDocEasy PDF will alleviate a lot of fears. The actual title is _Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson._ He did a wonderful job staying true to his initial statement: **'Calculus Made Easy, being a very simple introduction to those beautiful methods which are generally called by terrifying names.**

- I also use _Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Stewart_, which is great as well. However, the more comfortable you become with the jargon and visualizing certain concepts, the easier everything gets

- With a ton of playful hardwork.

- I say _'playful hard work'_ because if you're too serious and too focused on getting it right and fast all the time, you're only hindering your progression. By keeping things playful and allowing yourself to be **wrong** and understand **why** you're wrong, you'll grow much faster.

- The PDF labeled  **_'Instagram Questions'_**  contains calculus problems that would randomly appear on my explore page. I'd try to solve them without any expectations—sometimes I got them right, sometimes I didn't. But that was the fun part. I wasn’t treating it like a test or something I had to know because it’s on the syllabus. I approached it playfully and willingly, which is why I always learned something from the comments, even when I got it right.

# EndGoal

- **My goal is simple: I will continuously revise all the resources I’ve listed, which are my personal work, ensuring they are as simple as possible without oversimplifying, while being precise and demonstrating growing math skills.**
