# Argument!
	"People do stupid things because of ignorance"

Ignorance can lead to poor decision making. People often act without understanding the consequences, which can result in harmful or unwise actions. for example:
   - Misinterpret risks
   - Follow Misinformation
   - Resist Change
   - Engage in Harmful Behavior

   I'm more concerned with the psychological aspects especially in regards to resisting change.
   And some people may know are not know, but resisting change is very common in human behavior, which is rooted in many psychological and social factors.
