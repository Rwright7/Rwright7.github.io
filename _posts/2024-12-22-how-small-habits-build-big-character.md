# Importance of Habits

**What does the word "Habit" mean?**

The word "habit" derives from the Latin words *habere*, which means "have, consist of," and *habitus*, which means "condition, or state of being." The meaning then progressed to the more common use of the word, which is "acquired mode of behavior" (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.).

The power of habit is nothing more than small actions repeated consistently, which inadvertently shape the entire trajectory of your life. The brain is wired to make things automatic, saving energy. When you do something repeatedly, it becomes a habit and eventually gets encoded in your brain, requiring less effort or thought. Those small, automatic behaviors compound into huge results later on in life, whether positive or negative.

Another way to think about habits: Habits are like invisible scripts running your life. What you do daily, no matter how small, ultimately defines your success or failure in the long term.

**Habits and Temperament**

The word "temperament" refers to "a person's natural mood, character, or emotional makeup—the way they typically respond to situations, people, or challenges. It's the inherent part of someone's personality that shapes how they feel, think, and behave, especially under stress or in everyday interactions. It’s not something easily changed, and it plays a key role in how someone reacts to the world around them." By the definition of "habit" as an acquired mode of behavior, we can see how they intertwine with each other.

It is no secret that people with poor temperament often react impulsively, make decisions based on emotions, or avoid difficult situations rather than addressing them calmly. These reactions become habitual patterns that shape their daily lives. Over time, these patterns can prevent individuals from consistently working toward goals, maintaining relationships, or making wise financial decisions.

For example, Alfred Kahn, who ran **Trans World Airlines (TWA)**, Eliot Spitzer, the **former Governor of New York**, and Richard M. Nixon, **the former President of the United States**, all displayed poor temperament countless times.

While someone might know better on a logical level, their emotional responses become habitual and automatic, undermining their long-term success.

Alfred Kahn is a prime example. A brief overview of Kahn reveals that he was reactive, and his sometimes erratic style contributed to TWA's decline, especially in the face of growing competition and mounting debt. His inability to manage stress and make steady, long-term decisions eventually led to the airline's financial troubles and his departure from the company.

In essence, temperament is just another habit. What you practice daily—whether it's patience, optimism, or emotional regulation—becomes the invisible script that drives your life. And because habits compound over time, those who cultivate good habits of temperament are more likely to succeed in the long run.

**It is important to remember that even if someone is naturally calm, patient, or emotionally intelligent, they still need to *hone* and *cultivate* that temperament over time to ensure it remains strong and effective. Good temperament, like any other trait, needs regular attention and practice to stay sharp.**

Even the most naturally calm person can have moments of weakness—stressful situations, fatigue, or emotional overload can challenge their best qualities. If they don’t practice their good temperament regularly, they risk letting their automatic responses become less thoughtful and more reactive.

To believe that one's temperament is static would be a grave mistake. Life situations do change, and you may encounter new pressures or challenges that require you to refine how you respond. A good temperament, when actively honed, allows someone to *adapt* to different circumstances while maintaining control.

In 1890, William James, a pioneering philosopher and psychologist, addressed the subject of habit in his book, *The Principles of Psychology*. James viewed habit as a natural tendency to navigate life. To him, "living creatures... are bundles of habits," and those habits that have "an innate tendency are called instincts." James also explains how habits can govern our lives. He states, "Any sequence of mental action which has been frequently repeated tends to perpetuate itself; so that we find ourselves automatically prompted to think, feel, or do what we have been before accustomed to think, feel, or do, under like circumstances, without any consciously formed purpose or anticipated result" (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.).
